RackHD API Overview
=============================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Our REST based API is the abstraction layer for the low-level management tasks
that are performed on hardware devices, and information about those devices.
For example, when a compute server is "discovered" (see :doc:`../architecture`
for more details on this process), the information about that server is expressed
as `nodes` and `catalogs` in the RackHD API. When you want to re-image that
compute node, the RackHD API is used to activate a workflow containing the tasks
that are appropriate to doing that function.

The RackHD API can be used to manage nodes, catalogs, workflows, tasks, templates,
pollers, and other entities. For the complete list of functions, generate the RackHD
API documentation as described below or download the latest from
`https://bintray.com/rackhd/docs/apidoc#files <https://bintray.com/rackhd/docs/apidoc#files>`_.

**List All Nodes**

.. code::

  curl http://<server>:8080/api/current/nodes | python -mjson.tool

**Get the Active Workflow**

.. code::

  curl http://<server>:8080/api/current/nodes/<identifier>/workflows/?active=true | python -mjson.tool


Starting and Stopping the API Server
------------------------------------

The API server runs by default. Use the following commands to stop or start the API server.

================ ===============================
 Action           Command
================ ===============================
Stop API server   `sudo service on-http stop`
Start API server  `sudo service on-http start`
================ ===============================


Generating API Documentation
-----------------------------

You can generate an HTML version of the API documentation by cloning the *on-http*
repository and running the following command.

.. code::

  $ git clone https://github.com/RackHD/on-http
  $ cd on-http
  $ npm install
  $ npm run apidoc
  $ npm run taskdoc

The default and example quick start build that we describe in :doc:`../tutorials/vagrant`
has the API docs rendered and embedded within that instance for easy use, available
at ``http://[IP ADDRESS OF VM]:8080/docs/`` for the 1.1 API documentation, and
``http://[IP ADDRESS OF VM]:8080/swagger-ui/`` for the current (2.0) and Redfish API documentation.

RackHD Client Libraries
-----------------------------

The 2.0 API generates a swagger API definition file that can be used to
create client libraries with `swagger`_. To create this file locally, you can
check out the on-http library and run the commands::

    npm install
    npm run apidoc

The resulting files will be in ``build/swagger-doc`` and will be pdf files that are documentation
for the 2.0 API (rackhd-api-2.1.0.pdf) and the Redfish API (rackhd-redfish-v1-1.1.1.pdf).

To create a client library you can run the command::

    npm run client -- -l <language>

Where the `language` you input can currently be python, go, or java. Go is generated
using go-swagger and python and java are generated using swagger-codegen. This command
will generate client libraries for the 2.0 API and Redfish API and will be in the saved
in the directories ``on-http/on-http-api2.0` and ``on-http/on-http-redfish-1.0`` , respectively.

You can also use the `swagger generator`_ online tool to generate a client zip
bundle for a variety of languages, including python, Java, javascript, ruby,
scala, php, and more.

Examples using the python client library
----------------------------------------

Getting a list of nodes ::

    from on_http import NodesApi, ApiClient, Configuration

        config = Configuration()
        config.debug = True
        config.verify_ssl = False

        client = ApiClient(host='http://localhost:9090',header_name='Content-Type',header_value='application/json')
        nodes = NodesApi(api_client=client)
        nodes.api2_0_nodes_get()
        print client.last_response.data

Deprecated 1.1 API - Getting a list of nodes::

    from on_http import NodesApi, ApiClient, Configuration

    config = Configuration()
    config.debug = True
    config.verify_ssl = False

    client = ApiClient(host='http://localhost:9090',header_name='Content-Type',header_value='application/json')
    nodes = NodesApi(api_client=client)
    nodes.api1_1_nodes_get()
    print client.last_response.data

Or the same asynchronously (with a callback)::

    def cb_func(resp):
    print 'GET /nodes callback!', resp

    thread = nodes.api2_0_nodes_get(callback=cb_func)

Deprecated 1.1 API - Or the same asynchronously (with a callback)::

    def cb_func(resp):
    print 'GET /nodes callback!', resp

    thread = nodes.api1_1_nodes_get(callback=cb_func)

Using Pagination
-----------------------------

The RackHD 2.0 ``/nodes``, ``/pollers``, and ``/workflows`` APIs support pagination
using ``$skip`` and ``$top`` query parameters.

=========== =================================================================================================================
 Parameter   Description
=========== =================================================================================================================
``$skip``        An integer indicating the number of items that should be skipped starting with the first item in the collection.
``$top``         An integer indicating the number of items that should be included in the response.
=========== =================================================================================================================

These parameters can be used individually or combined to display any subset of consecutive
resources in the collection.

Here is an example request using $skip and $top to get get the second page of nodes with
four items per page.

::

    curl http://localhost:8080/api/current/nodes?$skip=4&$top=4

RackHD will add a link header to assist in traversing a large collection.  Links will be added
if either ``$skip`` or ``$top`` is used and the size of the collection is greater than the
number of resources displayed (i.e. the collection cannot fit on one page).  If applicable,
links to first, last, next, and previous pages will be included in the header.  The next and
previous links will be omitted for the last and first pages respectively.

Here is an example link header from a collection containing 1000 nodes.

::

    </api/current/nodes?$skip=0&$top=4>; rel="first",
    </api/current/nodes?$skip=1004&$top=4>; rel="last",
    </api/current/nodes?$skip=0&$top=4>; rel="prev",
    </api/current/nodes?$skip=8&$top=4>; rel="next"
