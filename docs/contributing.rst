Contributing to RackHD
======================

We certainly welcome and encourage contributions in the form of issues and pull requests, but please read the
guidelines in this document before you get involved.

Since our project is relatively new, we don't yet have many hard and fast rules. As the project grows and more
people get involved, we will solidify and extend our guidelines as needed.


Communicating with Other Users
-----------------------------------------

We maintain a mailing list at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/rackhd. You can visit the group through the web page or subscribe directly by sending email to rackhd+subscribe@googlegroups.com.

We also have a #RackHD slack channel at https://codecommunity.slack.com/messages/rackhd/. You can receive an invite by requesting one at http://community.emccode.com.


Submitting Contributions
----------------------------------------


To submit coding additions or changes for a repository, fork the repository and clone it locally. Then use a unique branch to make commits and send pull requests.

Keep your pull requests limited to a single issue. Make sure that the description of the pull request is clear and complete.

Run your changes against existing tests or create new ones if needed. Keep tests as simple as possible.  At a minimum, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
For more information about contributing changes to RacKHD, please see :doc:`devguide/contributing`

After receiving the pull request, our core committers will give you feedback on your work and may request that you make further changes and resubmit the request. The core committers will handle all merges.

If you have questions about the disposition of a request, feel free to email one of our core committers.
