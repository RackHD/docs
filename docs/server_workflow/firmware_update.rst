Firmware update Example using SKU Pack
--------------------------------------

This example provides instructions on how to flash a BMC image on a Quanta (node) using SKU Pack.

1. Wait for discovery to complete and get nodes to check if node has been discovered successfully

     **Get Nodes**
     ::
     
         GET /api/current/nodes
     ::
     
         curl <server>/api/current/nodes


2. Post the obm settings if they don't already exist for the node. An example on how to do this is shown in Section 7.1.8.1 here http://rackhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/vagrant.html#adding-a-sku-definition Section 7.1.8.1


3. Acquire BMC files and utilities from the vendor. Go to the Quanta directory, a sub-directory of the root folder of on-skupack, extract the BMC image and BMC upgrade executable into the static/bmc of the skupack and update the config.json with the md5sum of the firmware image.

4. The firmware files and update utilities need to be built into a SKU package
  
     **Build SKU Package**
     ::
     
         $ ./build-package.bash <sku_pack_directory> <subname>
     <sku_pack_directory> must be one of the directory names containing the node type on the root directory of on-skupack, e.g., it can be quanta-d51-1u, quanta-t41,dell-r630, etc, and <subname> can be any name a user likes. A {sku_pack_directory_subname}.tar.gz will be created in tarballs folder of the same directory.
    
     ::
        
        $ ls ./tarballs
          sku_pack_directory_subname.tar.gz
          
5. The SKU package that was built needs to be registered

     **POST the tarball**
     ::
     
        curl -X POST --data-binary @tarballs/sku_pack_directory_subname.tar.gz localhost:8080/api/current/skus/pack

   The above command will return a SKU ID. If an error like "Duplicate name found" is returned in place of the SKU ID, check the database and delete the preexisting SKU package.

.. _Pollers: http://rackhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rackhd/pollers.html?highlight=ipmi%20pollers
6. The pollers associated with the node need to be paused before POST'ing the Workflow to flash a new BMC image. This is needed to avoid seeing any poller errors in the log while BMC is offline. Further information on IPMI poller properties can be found at `Pollers`_

    **Get List of Active Pollers Associated With a Node**

       .. code-block:: REST

          GET /api/current/nodes/:id/pollers

       .. code-block:: REST

          curl <server>/api/current/nodes/<nodeid>/pollers
  
    **Update a Single Poller to pause the poller**

       .. code-block:: REST

           PATCH /api/current/pollers/:id
           {
                "paused": true
           }

       .. code-block:: REST

           curl -X PATCH \
              -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
              -d '{"paused":true}' \
              <server>/api/current/pollers/<pollerid>

7. The workflow to flash a new BMC image to a Quanta node needs to be POST'ed
If a user would upgrade a node without reboot at the end or run BMC upgrade with a file override, a user need add a payload when posting the workflow. Details please refer to the README.md under Quanta directory.

     **POST Workflow**
     
       .. code-block:: REST

          POST /api/current/nodes/:id/workflows?name=Graph.Flash.Quanta.Bmc

       .. code-block:: REST

          curl -X POST <server>/api/current/nodes/<nodeid>/workflows?name=Graph.Flash.Quanta.Bmc
          
8. Check if any active workflows on that node exist to make sure the workflow has completed
   
     **GET active Workflow**
          
       .. code-block:: REST

          GET /api/current/nodes/<id>/workflows/active

       .. code-block:: REST

          curl <server>/api/current/nodes/<id>/workflows/active
          
          
If a remote viewing session exists for the node, check the BMC firmware to verify the version has been updated.
