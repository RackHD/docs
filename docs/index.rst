RackHD
======

RackHD(TM) is a technology stack up created for enabling hardware management and operations,
to provide cohesive APIs to enabled automated infrastructure. In a Converged Infrastructure
Platform (CIP) architecture, RackHD software provides hardware management and orchestration
(M&O). It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying
physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves
as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific
hardware in place.

The project is a collection of libraries and applications housed at https://github.com/RackHD/
and documentation hosted at http://rackhd.readthedocs.org. The code for RackHD is a combination
of Python, Javascript (NodeJS), and C, available under the Apache 2.0 license (or
compatible sublicences for library dependencies).
