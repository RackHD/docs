RackHD is a technology stack for enabling automated hardware
management and orchestration through cohesive APIs. It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers
and the underlying physical hardware.

Developers can use the RackHD APIs to incorporate RackHD functionality into a larger orchestration system or to create a
user interface for managing hardware services regardless of the underlying hardware in place.

The project is a collection of libraries and applications housed at https://github.com/RackHD/ and available
under the Apache 2.0 license (or compatible sublicenses for library dependencies). The code for RackHD is a combination
of JavaScript and C. The RackHD documentation is hosted at http://rackhd.readthedocs.org.
