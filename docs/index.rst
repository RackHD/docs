RackHD is a technology stack for enabling automated hardware management and
orchestration through cohesive APIs. It serves as an abstraction layer between
other management layers and the underlying, vendor-specific physical hardware.

Developers can use the RackHD APIs to incorporate RackHD functionality into a
larger orchestration system or to create a user interface for managing hardware
services regardless of the underlying hardware in place.

The project is housed at https://github.com/RackHD/ and available under the
Apache 2.0 license (or compatible sublicenses for library dependencies). This
RackHD documentation is hosted at http://rackhd.readthedocs.io.
