RackHD is a technology stack up created for enabling hardware
management and orchestration, to provide cohesive APIs to enabled automated infrastructure.
In a Converged Infrastructure Platform (CIP) architecture, RackHD software provides hardware
management and orchestration (M&O). It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers
and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD APIs as a component in a
larger orchestration system or to create a user interface for managing hardware services
regardless of the underlying hardware in place.

The project is a collection of libraries and applications housed at https://github.com/RackHD/
and documentation hosted at http://rackhd.readthedocs.org. The code for RackHD is a combination
of Javascript/Node.js and C, available under the Apache 2.0 license (or
compatible sublicences for library dependencies).
