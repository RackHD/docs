Configuration Parameters
-----------------------------

The following table describes the configuration parameters in config.json:


.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 100
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Parameter
      - Description
    * - amqp
      - URI for accessing the AMQP interprocess communications channel. RackHD can be configured to use a single AMQP server or a AMQP cluster consisting of multiple AMQP servers.

        For a single AMQP server use the following formats:

        .. code-block:: json

            "amqp": "amqp[s]://localhost",
            "amqp": "amqp[s]://<host>:<port>",

        For multiple AMQP servers use an array with the following format:

        .. code-block:: json

            "amqp": ["amqp[s]://<host_1>:<port_1>","amqp[s]://<host_2>:<port_2>",..., "amqp[s]://<host_n:<port_n>"],
    * - amqpSsl
      - SSL setting used to access the AMQP channel.

        To enable SSL connections to the AMQP channel:

        .. code-block:: json

            {
                "enabled": true,
                "keyFile": "/path/to/key/file",
                "certFile": "/path/to/cert/file",
                "caFile": "/path/to/cacert/file"
            }

        The key, certificate, and certificate authority files must be in pem format. Alternatively, ``pfxFile`` can be used to read key and certificate from a single file.

    * - apiServerAddress
      - External facing IP address of the API server
    * - rackhdPublicIp
      - RackHD's public IP
    * - apiServerPort
      - External facing port of the API server
    * - dhcpPollerActive
      - Set to true to enable the dhcp isc lease poller (defaults to false)
    * - dhcpLeasesPath
      - Path to dhcpd.leases file.
    * - dhcpGateway
      - Gateway IP for the network for DHCP
    * - dhcpProxyBindAddress
      - IP for DHCP proxy server to bind  (defaults to '0.0.0.0'). **Note:** DHCP binds to 0.0.0.0 to support broadcast request/response within Node.js.
    * - dhcpProxyBindPort
      - Port for DHCP proxy server to bind (defaults to 4011).
    * - dhcpProxyOutPort
      - Port for DHCP proxy server to respond to legacy boot clients (defaults to 68).
    * - dhcpProxyEFIOutPort
      - Port for DHCP proxy server to respond to EFI clients (defaults to 4011).
    * - httpApiDocsDirectory
      - Fully-qualified directory containing the API docs.
    * - httpEndpoints
      - Collection of http/https endpoints. See details in :ref:`http-endpoint-config-ref-label`
    * - httpFileServiceRoot
      - Directory path for for storing uploaded files on disk.
    * - httpFileServiceType
      - Backend storage mechanism for file service. Currently only FileSystem is supported.
    * - fileServerAddress
      - Optional. Node facing IP address of the static file server. See :ref:`static-file-server-label`.
    * - fileServerPort
      - Optional. Port of the static file server. See :ref:`static-file-server-label`.
    * - fileServerPath
      - Optional. Access path of the static file server. See :ref:`static-file-server-label`.
    * - httpProxies
      - Optional HTTP/HTTPS proxies list. There are 3 parameters for each proxy:

        "localPath"/"remotePath" are optional and defaults to "/". A legal "localPath"/"remotePath" string must start with slash and ends without slash, like "/mirrors".
        If "localPath" is assigned to an existing local path like "/api/current/nodes", proxy won't work. Instead the path will keep its original feature and function.
        "server" is a must, both http and https servers are supported. A legal "server" string must ends without slash like "http://centos.eecs.wsu.edu". Instead "http://centos.eecs.wsu.edu/" is illegal.

        Example:

        { "server": "http://centos.eecs.wsu.edu", "localPath": "/centos" } would map http requests to local directory /centos/ to http://centos.eecs.wsu.edu/

        { "server": "https://centos.eecs.wsu.edu", "remotePath": "/centos" } would map http requests to local directory / to https://centos.eecs.wsu.edu/centos/

        Note: To ensure this feature works, the httpProxies need be separately enabled for specified HTTP/HTTPS endpoint. See details in :ref:`http-endpoint-config-ref-label`
    * - httpFrontendDirectory

    * - httpStaticDirectory
      - Fully-qualified directory to where static HTTP content is served
    * - maxTaskPayloadSize
      - Maximum payload size expected through TASK runner API callbacks from microkernel
    * - mongo
      - URI for accessing MongoDB. To support Mongo Replica Set feature, URI format is, mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]
    * - migrate
      - The `migrate` setting controls the auto-migration strategy that every time RackHD loads, the strategy should be one of `safe`, `alter` and `drop`.

        **NOTE**: It's extremely important to set the `migrate` to `safe` when working with existing databases, otherwise, you will very likely lose data! The `alter` and `drop` strategies are only recommended in development environment.
        You could see detail description for each migration strategy from this link https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/master/concepts/ORM/model-settings.md#migrate

        The RackHD default migration strategy is `safe`.
    * - sharedKey
      - A 32 bit base64 key encoded string relevant for aes-256-cbc, defaults to 'qxfO2D3tIJsZACu7UA6Fbw0avowo8r79ALzn+WeuC8M='. The default can be replaced by a 256 byte randomly generated base64 key encoded string.

        Example generating a key with OpenSSL:

        .. code-block:: shell

            openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -k secret -P -md sha1

        See documentation at https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html
    * - autoCreateObm
      - Allow rackHD to setup IPMI OBM settings on active dicovery by creating a new BMC user on the compute node.


These configurations can also be overridden by setting environment variables in the
process that's running each application, or on the command line when running node directly.
For example, to override the value of amqp for the configuration, you could use::

    export amqp=amqp://another_host:5763

prior to running the relevant application.

HTTPS/TLS Configuration
-----------------------------

To use TLS, a private RSA key and X.509 certificate must be provided. On Ubuntu and
Mac OS X, the openssl command line tool can be used to generate keys and certificates.

For internal development purposes, a self-signed certificate can be used. When using a self-signed
certificate, clients must manually include a rule to trust the certificate's authenticity.

By default, the application uses a self-signed certificate issued by Monorail which requires no
configuration. Custom certificates can also be used with some configuration.

**Parameters**

See the table in `Configuration Parameters`_ for information about HTTP/HTTPS configuration parameters.
These parameters beging with *HTTP* and *HTTPS*.

BMC Username and Password Configuration
---------------------------------------

A node gets discovered and the BMC IPMI comes up with a default username/password. User can automatically set
IPMI OBM settings  using a  default user name('__rackhd__') and an auto generated password in rackHD by adding the following
to RackHD ``config.json``:

.. code-block:: shell

   "autoCreateObm": "true"

If a user wants to change the BMC credentials later in time, when the node has been already discovered and database updated, a separate workflow located at ``on-taskgraph/lib/graphs/bootstrap-bmc-credentials-setup-graph.js`` can be posted using Postman or Curl command.

    POST:        http://server-ip:8080/api/current/workflows/

add the below content in the json body for payload (example node identifier and username, password shown below)

.. code-block:: JSON

   {
       "name": "Graph.Bootstrap.With.BMC.Credentials.Setup",
       "options": {
            "defaults": {
                "graphOptions": {
                    "target": "56e967f5b7a4085407da7898",
                    "generate-pass": {
                        "user": "7",
                        "password": "7"
                    }
                },
                "nodeId": "56e967f5b7a4085407da7898"
            }
        }
   }

By running this workflow, a boot-graph runs to bootstrap an ubuntu image on the node again and set-bmc-credentials-graph runs the required tasks to update the BMC credentials. Below is a snippet of the 'Bootstrap-And-Set-Credentials graph', when the graph is posted the node reboots and starts the discovery process

.. code-block:: javascript

  module.exports = {
    friendlyName: 'Bootstrap And Set Credentials',
    injectableName: 'Graph.Bootstrap.With.BMC.Credentials.Setup',
    options: {
        defaults: {
            graphOptions: {
                target: null
            },
            nodeId: null
        }
    },
    tasks: [
        {
            label: 'boot-graph',
            taskDefinition: {
                friendlyName: 'Boot Graph',

                implementsTask: 'Task.Base.Graph.Run',
                options: {
                    graphName: 'Graph.BootstrapUbuntu',
                    defaults : {
                        graphOptions: {   }
                    }
                },
                properties: {}
            }
        },
        {
            label: 'set-bmc-credentials-graph',
            taskDefinition: {
                friendlyName: 'Run BMC Credential Graph',
                injectableName: 'Task.Graph.Run.Bmc',
                implementsTask: 'Task.Base.Graph.Run',
                options: {
                    graphName: 'Graph.Set.Bmc.Credentials',
                    defaults : {
                        graphOptions: {   }
                    }
                },
                properties: {}
            },
            waitOn: {
                'boot-graph': 'finished'
            }
        },
        {
            label: 'finish-bootstrap-trigger',
            taskName: 'Task.Trigger.Send.Finish',
            waitOn: {
                'set-bmc-credentials-graph': 'finished'
            }
        }
    ]
 };

To remove the BMC credentials, User can run the following workflow located at ``on-taskgraph/lib/graphs/bootstrap-bmc-credentials-remove-graph.js`` and can be posted using Postman or Curl command.

    POST:        http://server-ip:8080/api/current/workflows/

add the below content in the json body for payload (example node identifier and username, password shown below)

.. code-block:: JSON

       "name": "Graph.Bootstrap.With.BMC.Credentials.Remove",
       "options": {
            "defaults": {

            }
        }
   }


Certificates
-----------------------------

This section describes how to generate and install a self-signed certificate to use for testing.

Generating Self-Signed Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a key and certificate, skip down to the
`Installing Certificates`_ section.

First, generate a new RSA key::

    openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048


The file is output to *privkey.pem*. **Keep this private key secret. If it is
compromised, any corresponding certificate should be considered invalid.**

The next step is to generate a self-signed certificate using the private key::

    openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cacert.pem -days 9999

The *days* value is the number of days until the certificate expires.

When you run this command, OpenSSL prompts you for some metadata to associate with the new
certificate. The generated certificate contains the corresponding public key.

Installing Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have your private key and certificate, you'll need to let the application know where to
find them. It is suggested that you move them into the /opt/monorail/data folder.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv privkey.pem /opt/monorail/data/mykey.pem
    mv cacert.pem /opt/monorail/data/mycert.pem

Then configure the paths by editing *httpsCert* and *httpKey* in
/opt/monorail/config.json. (See the `Configuration Parameters`_ section above).

If using a self-signed certificate, add a security exception to your client of
choice. Verify the certificate by restarting on-http and visiting
`https://<host>/api/current/versions`.

**Note:** For information about OpenSSL, see the `OpenSSL documentation`_.

.. _OpenSSL documentation: https://www.openssl.org/docs/


.. _http-endpoint-config-ref-label:

Setup HTTP/HTTPS endpoint
-----------------------------

This section describes how to setup HTTP/HTTPS endpoints in RackHD.
An endpoint is an instance of HTTP or HTTPS server that serves a group of APIs. Users can
choose to enable authentication or enable HTTPS for each endpoint.

There is currently one API group defined in RackHD:

- the northbound-api-router API group. This is the API group that is used by users

.. code-block:: JSON

Raid Configuration
-----------------------------

Setting up the docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the correct tooling (storcli for Quanta/Intel and perccli for Dell) you will need to build the docker image using the following steps:

(1). Add the repo https://github.com/RackHD/on-imagebuilder

(2). Refer to the Requirements section of the Readme in the on-imagebuilder repo to install latest version of docker: https://github.com/RackHD/on-imagebuilder#requirements

(3). For Quanta/Intel storcli - https://github.com/RackHD/on-imagebuilder#oem-tools

Refer to the **OEM tools** section:  OEM docker images **raid** and **secure_erase** require storcli_1.17.08_all.deb being copied into raid and secure-erase under on-imagebuilder/oem. User can download it from http://docs.avagotech.com/docs/1.17.08_StorCLI.zip

(4). For Dell PERCcli: https://github.com/RackHD/on-imagebuildera#oem-tools

Refer to the **OEM tools** section to download and unzip the percCLI package and derive a debian version using ‘alien’
There is no .deb version perccli tool. User can download .rpm perccli from https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER02444760M/1/perccli-1.11.03-1_Linux_A00.tar.gz unzip the package and then use alien to get a .deb version perccli tool as below:

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo apt-get install alien
   sudo alien -k perccli-1.11.03-1.noarch.rpm

OEM docker images **dell_raid** and **secure_erase** require perccli_1.11.03-1_all.deb being copied into dell-raid and secure-erase under on-imagebuilder/oem.

(5). Build the docker image.

.. code-block:: shell

    #This creates the dell.raid.docker.tar.xz image
    cd on-imagebuilder/oem/dell-raid
    sudo docker build -t rackhd/micro .
    sudo docker save rackhd/micro | xz -z > dell.raid.docker.tar.xz

    #This creates the raid.docker.tar.xz image
    cd on-imagebuilder/oem/raid
    sudo docker build -t rackhd/micro .
    sudo docker save rackhd/micro | xz -z > raid.docker.tar.xz

(6). Copy the image dell.raid.docker.tar.xz or raid.docker.tar.xz to /on-http/static/http/common

(7). Restart the RackHD service


Posting the Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    POST:        http://server-ip:8080/api/2.0/nodes/:id/workflows/?name=Graph.Bootstrap.Megaraid.Configure

add the below example content in the json body for payload

.. code-block:: JSON

   {
      "options": {
          "config-raid":{
                     "ssdStoragePoolArr":[],
                     "ssdCacheCadeArr":[{
                            "enclosure": 252,
                            "type": "raid0",
                            "drives":"[0]"
                     }],
                     "controller": 0,
                     "path":"/opt/MegaRAID/storcli/storcli64",
                     "hddArr":[{
                             "enclosure": 252,
                             "type": "raid0",
                             "drives":"[1]"
                      },
                      {
                            "enclosure": 252,
                            "type": "raid1",
                            "drives":"[4,5]"
                      }]
         }
      }
   }

Notes:
ssdStoragePoolArr, ssdCacheCadeArr, hddArr should be passed as empty arrays if they don’t need to be configure like the “ssdStoragePoolArr” array in the example payload above is an empty array.
For CacheCade (ssdCacheCadeArr) to work the controller should have the ability to configure it. 

Payload Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The drive information for payload can be gathered from the node catalogs using the api below:

    GET /api/current/nodes/<id>/catalogs/<source>
    
Or from the node’s microkernel:
(Note: the workflow does not stop in the micro-kernel. In order to be able to stop in the microkernel the workflow needs to be updated to remove the last two tasks.)

.. code-block:: javascript
    
   {
       label: 'refresh-catalog-megaraid',
       taskName: 'Task.Catalog.megaraid',
       waitOn: {
           'config-raid': 'succeeded'
       }
    },
    {
       label: 'final-reboot',
       taskName: 'Task.Obm.Node.Reboot',
       waitOn: {
           'refresh-catalog-megaraid': 'finished'
       }
    }
    
The elements in the arrays represent the EID of the drives (run this command in the micro-kernel storcli 64 /c0 show)

.. code-block:: txt

"hddArr": is the array of hard drives that will take part of the storage pool 
"ssdStoragePoolArr": is the array of solid state drives that will take part of the storage pool 
"ssdCacheCadeArr": is the array of hard drives that will take part of CacheCade 

Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the workflow runs successfully, you should be able to see the newly created virtual disks either from the catalogs or from the monorail micro-kernel
