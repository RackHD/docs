Authorization
=============================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

API access control is enabled when authentication is enabled.  The Access Control is controlled per
API and per API method.  A GET on an API can have different access control than a POST on the same API.

Privileges
-----------------------------

A privilege grants access to an API resource and an action to perform on that resource.  For example,
a 'read' privilege may grant GET access on a set of APIs, but may not also grant POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
access to those same APIs.  To issue POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE methods to an API, a 'write' privilege 
may be required.
